# woff2otf

This is a small utility to convert WOFF files to the OTF font format. It uses Python 3, so you need to have it installed in order to run it.

## Usage
To run the script, simply invoke it from the command line:
```
./woff2otf.py font.woff
```

The first parameter is the source file (the WOFF) font. The code will automatically use the same name as the woff file. (please do not use excess "." in your file names.
